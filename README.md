# Project Name: DocuAI

## Overview
DocuAI is a project that involves interacting with the OpenAI API and performing file management functions. The provided files contain Python code that enables the interaction with OpenAI and the handling of files for documentation purposes.

## File Contents
### 1. File: `file-pYA9xrMe37boWQtNDWHVZ6Jk`
#### Content:
```python
import os
import keyring
from openai import OpenAI

class Writer:

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.api_key = keyring.get_password("DOCUAI", "api_key")
        self.client = OpenAI(api_key=self.api_key)
        self.assistant_id = "asst_NhtwTnQkISVeqVhzYXHB1Kzh"
        self.assistant = self.client.beta.assistants.retrieve(self.assistant_id)

    def write(self) -> None:
        
        files = []

        for file in self.get_files():
        
            files.append(self.client.files.create(file=open(file, "rb"), purpose="assistants").id)

        # ... (code continuation)

    def get_files(self) -> list[str]:
        
        current_dir = os.getcwd()

        extensions = [".py", ".c", ".html", ".java", ".js", ".css", ".php", ".rb", ".ts"]
        files = []

        for root, dirs, file_names in os.walk(current_dir):
            for file in file_names:
                if file.endswith(tuple(extensions)) and file != "__init__.py":
                    files.append(os.path.join(root, file))

        return files

w = Writer()
f = w.write()
```
#### Description:
The file contains a Python class `Writer` that interacts with the OpenAI API. The `Writer` class has methods for initializing the API key, writing files, and obtaining a list of files in the current directory. The `write` method involves creating and managing files for the OpenAI assistant, including sending messages and retrieving file content.

### 2. File: `file-RZxefmm15BizaAEiepEvvCGi`
#### Content:
```python
import os
import keyring 
from openai import OpenAI

def add_api_key(api_key: str):
    keyring.set_password("DOCUAI", "api_key", api_key)

def main():
    print("Hello World!")
```
#### Description:
This file contains Python code that includes a function for adding an API key and a main function that prints "Hello World!"

## Project Usage
The project involves utilizing the provided Python code to interact with the OpenAI API, manage files, and perform various tasks related to the documentation process.

## Next Steps
To utilize the code and interact with the OpenAI API, ensure that the necessary API key is configured. Additionally, the code can be further customized or extended as per specific requirements for file management and interaction with the OpenAI platform.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the required permissions and access to OpenAI API are in place before running the code.
- Modify the code as needed to integrate with the existing project environment or documentation processes.
